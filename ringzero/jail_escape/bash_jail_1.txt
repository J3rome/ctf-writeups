Output is redirected to variable

We can spawn a shell using "bash"

We can then cat the 'flag.txt' file to stderr :
cat flag.txt >&2

---------
For easier output, we can first send "bash" to the output.
In the newly spawned shell, we can "bash >&2" which will give us a nice shell with all output redirected to stderr

This is usefull because we come back to this shell often to test stuff for other levels
