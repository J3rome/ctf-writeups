# TODO : Fill me up

From memory : Used bash expansion to go over the restricted characters constraint

Solution : eval eval {o..u}y{q..u}hon\\ -m\\ SimpleHTTPSe{q..u}ve{q..u}\\;

Which will run multiple commands, most of them will fail but at some point we get an httpserver and we can query it using level1 shell.

We could have also forwarded port using SSH and query the httpserver locally
